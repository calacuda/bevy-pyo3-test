# bevy-pyo3-test

 A test to where rendering is handled in bevy and displaying the render is handled by pygame. This is done so this stratagy can be used to leverage bevy's powerful rendering engine, and speed but in an enviornment that lacks a windowing system. For example, retro emulation handhelds which often lack a windowing system but have pygame & SDL2 (like the [KNULLI custom firmware](https://knulli.org/)).
